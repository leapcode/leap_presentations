The 2 awesome improvisers saved the talk from boredom, most of it is coming over from europython, iff, calafou talks with some changes/additions/etc.

CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE DIRECTLY IN HTML!~!!!!!!

Make sure to install some emoji font, flush font cache and/or restart programs!
apt install fonts-symbola for example

this is a slightly chaotic desk, but it has some extras *after* the end.
